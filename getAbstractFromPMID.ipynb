      "widespread impact recently. We aim to investigate the clinical characteristics of\n",
      "COVID-19 children with different severities and allergic status.\n",
      "METHODS: Data extracted from the electronic medical records, including\n",
      "demographics, clinical manifestations, comorbidities, laboratory and\n",
      "immunological results, and radiological images of 182 hospitalized COVID-19\n",
      "children, were summarized and analyzed.\n",
      "RESULTS: The median age was 6 years, ranging from 3 days to 15 years, and there\n",
      "were more boys (male-female ratio about 2:1) within the studied 182 patients.\n",
      "Most of the children were infected by family members. Fever (43.4%) and dry cough\n",
      "(44.5%) were common symptoms, and gastrointestinal manifestations accounted for\n",
      "11.0%, including diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. 71.4% had abnormal\n",
      "chest computed tomography (CT) scan images, and typical signs of pneumonia were\n",
      "ground-glass opacity and local patchy shadowing on admission. Laboratory results \n",
      "were mostly within normal ranges, and only a small ratio of lymphopenia (3.9%)\n",
      "and eosinopenia (29.5%) were observed. The majority (97.8%) of infected children \n",
      "were not severe, and 24 (13.2%) of them had asymptomatic infections. Compared to \n",
      "children without pneumonia (manifested as asymptomatic and acute upper\n",
      "respiratory infection), children with pneumonia were associated with higher\n",
      "percentages of the comorbidity history, symptoms of fever and cough, and\n",
      "increased levels of serum procalcitonin, alkaline phosphatase, and serum\n",
      "interleukins (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α. There were no differences in\n",
      "treatments, duration of hospitalization, time from first positive to first\n",
      "negative nucleic acid testing, and outcomes between children with mild pneumonia \n",
      "and without pneumonia. All the hospitalized COVID-19 children had recovered\n",
      "except one death due to intussusception and sepsis. In 43 allergic children with \n",
      "COVID-19, allergic rhinitis (83.7%) was the major disease, followed by drug\n",
      "allergy, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and asthma. Demographics and clinical\n",
      "features were not significantly different between allergic and nonallergic\n",
      "groups. Allergic patients showed less increase in acute phase reactants,\n",
      "procalcitonin, D-dimer, and aspartate aminotransferase levels compared with all\n",
      "patients. Immunological profiles including circulating T, B, and NK lymphocyte\n",
      "subsets, total immunoglobulin and complement levels, and serum cytokines did not \n",
      "show any difference in allergic and pneumonia groups. Neither eosinophil counts\n",

      "CONCLUSION: Pediatric COVID-19 patients tended to have a mild clinical course.\n",
      "Patients with pneumonia had higher proportion of fever and cough and increased\n",
      "inflammatory biomarkers than those without pneumonia. There was no difference\n",
      "between allergic and nonallergic COVID-19 children in disease incidence, clinical\n",
